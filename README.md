# Piscine_CPP
A two week intensive of C++

### Quite a ~~decent~~ bearable version of CPP Piscine, with couple of interesting solutions. Please, do not be buffled by -42 for rush 01, it is because I ~~cheated~~ used part of my old rush 01, but with the new teammate this time

**_So, as they say, enjoy!_**
